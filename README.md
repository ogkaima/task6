For Visa

/^4\d{12}(?:\d{3})?$/


- `^`: Asserts the start of the string.
- `4`: corresponds to the fourth digit, which serves as Visa cards' initial digit.
- `\d{12}`: matches precisely twelve digits following the fourth digit. The remaining 12 digits of a 13-digit Visa card number come from this, since Visa cards can have either 13 or 16 digits total.
- `(?:\d{3})?`: This part `(?:\d{3})` matches exactly 3 digits, and the `?` at the end makes this group optional. This allows for the case of 16-digit Visa card numbers, where an additional 3 digits can be added after the initial 12.
- `$`: Asserts the end of the string.
Thus, this regular expression pattern determines whether the card number begins with a 4, which is the standard sequence for Visa card numbers, and then either 12 or 15 digits (for a total of 13 or 16 digits).
